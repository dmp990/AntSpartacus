# LaferrAPI

## Spring Boot & JPA/Hibernate Project

### Requirements

- Develop JPA entities and repositories for all 6 tables in the employees sample database in MySQL:
  - `departments`
  - `dept_emp`
  - `dept_manager`
  - `employees`
  - `salaries`
  - `titles`
- Create DAO and DTO classes to abstract the data access layer
- Add methods to enable the following functionality:
  - Find employees by last name
  - Find all the employees who worked in a named department on a given date
  - What is the average salary for a named department on a given date?
  - Given a job title name, what is the range of salary values within a given year?
  - Provide a summary of the size of each department (number of staff) over a given period (start year to end year)
  - Is there a gender pay gap? If so, quantify it
- Add 3 methods of your own to investigate similar questions
- Configure a Spring Boot application to host the JPA classes
- Use Spring Boot Test to create a comprehensive suite for your JPA classes and your DAO/DTO classes
- Include the result of your testing in the ```README.md``` file for the project on GitHub
- Include code coverage data for all JPA classes, with explanations for any low coverage levels, in the `README.md`
